A simple, modern to-do list app built with React and plain CSS. Add, remove, and mark tasks as complete. Code is structured into clear, reusable components and uses React hooks for state management.

## Features

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Remove tasks
- Clean, responsive UI

## Project Structure

- `App.jsx`: Main app logic and state
- `AddTodoForm.jsx`: Form for adding new tasks
- `TodoList.jsx`: Renders the list of tasks
- `TodoItem.jsx`: Individual task item
- `App.css`: App-specific styles

## Getting Started

```
npm install
```

### 2. Run the app in development mode

```
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown in your terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).
